Spellchecking dictionary for Yiddish language.The Yiddish spell checker (YIVO) was created
and is actualised by Simcha Taub of the ייִדיש לעבט project. It is a side effect of the works
on creating the Yiddish language corpus. Origin: http://yiddish-sources.com/yiddish-spell-checker

Yiddish spell checker contains entries in standard YIVO orthography and is compatible 
with the previously developed specification, which assumes not using typographic ligatures 
in the simple text because of their special functions. This specification is currently used 
and respected by the majority of scientific institutions and Yiddish language publishing houses.

First versions of the spell checker, which were unnumbered and weren’t widely spread, 
were based partly on Raphael A. Finkel’s MySpell dictionary available under LGPLv2+, GPLv2+ or MPLv1.1 licenses.

The spell checker is developed and distributed in three versions: as pure Hunspell files and 
Mozilla and OpenOffice packages with the same version number. Each of them is available under 
double licenses: GPLv3+ and Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0.
